# SpotifyAnalytics
 Analysis of albums from spotify:
 This dashboard pulls information from Spotify to look at music on a more detailed level.
 The program specifies an artist id, and pulls all of the albums associated with that artist.
 In the dashboard, the details of each track are shown, which give information on interesting metrics
 such as "danceability", "loudness", and "energy." As seen in the dashboard, a graph of "energy" levels
 per track is displayed. The data can be filtered by album to see how energy compares across albums, or it
 can be examined as a singular album. Below the graph is a table, that gives the details for the specified album,
 listed by each track.

 Data is obtained by using an API system from spotify:
